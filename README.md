This project is part of an open-access [BCG Virtual Experience Program with Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK/Data-Science-Virtual-Experience-Program#lp).

## Project Background & Objectives
BCG's client for this project is PowerCo, a major utilities company. PowerCo has had declining profits due to significant customer churn. BCG has been engaged to drive churn reduction within their Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) customers. As a data scientist, my task is to build a predictive model that can identify customers at high risk of churn.

## Tasks
1. Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
- understand business problem
- formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem 
- lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis
- communicate your thoughts and findings in an email 

    The final email is in the file `documents/Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing.pdf`.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data
- verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn
- provide a summary of findings and suggest next steps

    The EDA is in the file `notebooks/eda.ipynb`.

3. Feature Engineering & Modelling
- clean and engineer features for prediction
- predict churn probability with decision tree models
- evaluate model performance

    The corresponding notebook is in the file `notebooks/feature_engineering_and_modeling.ipynb`.

4. Findings & Recommendations
- make an executive summary of findings and provide recommendations

    The final report is in the file `documents/executive_summary.pdf`.
